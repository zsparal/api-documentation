Build your own checkout
=======================
Mollie provides a :doc:`hosted checkout system </payments/hosted-checkout>` out of the box. Your Mollie integration can
be as simple as creating a payment request, sending your customer to our checkout, and letting us handle the rest.

The guide on :doc:`accepting payments </payments/accepting-payments>` is a good starting point for this basic payment
flow.

If you are using an e-commerce platform, chances are we also provide a `module <https://www.mollie.com/integrations>`_
for it that offers a deeper checkout experience than this hosted checkout flow.

If, however, you are keen on building your own checkout experience, then read on.

The common checkout path
------------------------
The most common checkout path can be broken down into a handful of steps.

.. image:: images/checkout-flow-common-with-details@2x.png

The steps are roughly as follows:

#. Your customer wants to check out.

#. After setting up a payment using the :doc:`Create payment endpoint </reference/v2/payments-api/create-payment>`, you
   send your customer to our payment method selection screen.

#. Depending on the payment method, your customer may need to provide additional information.

#. Depending on the payment method, the customer may need to authenticate the transaction with their bank or card
   issuer.

#. The customer completes the payment, you receive a :doc:`webhook </overview/webhooks>`, and the customer is sent back
   to your website.

Embedding method selection
--------------------------
A good first step towards a deeper checkout integration is to provide your own payment method selection.

.. image:: images/checkout-flow-embedded-method-selection@2x.png

To accomplish this, first use the :doc:`Methods API </reference/v2/methods-api/list-methods>` to retrieve the payment
methods currently active on your account.

Once your customer has selected a payment method, use that selection to fill out the ``method`` field in the
:doc:`Create payment endpoint </reference/v2/payments-api/create-payment>`.

Deeper payment method integrations
----------------------------------
The next steps for a deeper integration depend on which payment methods you are looking to offer. The below list gives
an overview of the typical flow for each of our payment methods, and how they can be integrated further.

.. list-table::

.. image:: images/checkout-flow-embedded-credit-card-fields@2x.png

For the credit card payment method, you can fully embed the credit card input fields while staying PCI-DSS-compliant
using Mollie Components. Please refer to the guide on :doc:`Mollie Components </components/overview>` for more
information on how to integrate.

.. _embedding-issuer-selection:

Embedding issuer selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. image:: images/checkout-flow-embedded-ideal-issuer-selection@2x.png

For iDEAL, KBC/CBC, and gift cards, we offer a way to embed the issuer selection into the checkout flow. You can
retrieve the available issuers for these payment methods using the ``issuers`` include in the
:doc:`Methods API </reference/v2/methods-api/list-methods>`.

Once your customer has selected an issuer, use that selection to fill out the ``issuer`` field in the
:doc:`Create payment endpoint </reference/v2/payments-api/create-payment>`.
