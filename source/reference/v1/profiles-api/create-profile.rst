Create profile
==============
.. api-name:: Profiles API
   :version: 1

.. warning:: The v1 API has been deprecated. The v1 API will be supported for the foreseeable future, at least until
             July 2023. However, new features will only be added to the v2 API.

             The documentation for creating profiles in the new v2 API can be found
             :doc:`here </reference/v2/profiles-api/create-profile>`. For more information on the v2 API, refer to our
             :doc:`v2 migration guide </payments/migrating-v1-to-v2>`.

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v1/profiles

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: false
   :organization_access_tokens: false
   :oauth: true

In order to process payments, you need to create a website profile. A website profile can easily be created via the
Dashboard manually. However, the Mollie API also allows automatic profile creation via the Profiles API.

A profile's API keys can be set up with this API as well.
