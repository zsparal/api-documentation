List payment methods
====================
.. api-name:: Methods API
   :version: 1

.. warning:: The v1 API has been deprecated. The v1 API will be supported for the foreseeable future, at least until
             July 2023. However, new features will only be added to the v2 API.

             The documentation for listing payment methods in the new v2 API can be found
             :doc:`here </reference/v2/methods-api/list-methods>`. For more information on the v2 API, refer to our
             :doc:`v2 migration guide </payments/migrating-v1-to-v2>`.

.. endpoint::
   :method: GET
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v1/methods

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :organization_access_tokens: false

   :doc:`Get method </reference/v1/methods-api/get-method>` for available includes.

.. parameter:: recurringType
   :type: string
   :condition: optional

   Passing ``first`` will only show payment methods eligible for making a

   Possible values: ``first`` ``recurring``

   Passing a locale will sort the payment methods in the preferred order for the country, and translate the payment

Access token parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are using :doc:`organization access tokens </overview/authentication>` or are creating an
:doc:`OAuth app </connect/overview>`, the only mandatory extra query string parameter is the ``profileId`` parameter.
With it, you can specify which profile you want to list the methods of. Organizations can have multiple profiles for
each of their websites. See :doc:`Profiles API </reference/v1/profiles-api/get-profile>` for more information.

.. parameter:: profileId
   :type: string
   :condition: required
   :collapse: true

   The payment profile's unique identifier, for example ``pfl_3RkSN1zuPE``.

.. parameter:: testmode
   :type: boolean
   :condition: optional
   :collapse: true

   Set this to true to only retrieve payment methods available in test mode. By default, only live payment methods are
   returned.

Includes
^^^^^^^^
This endpoint allows you to include additional information by appending the following values via the ``include``
querystring parameter.

* ``issuers`` Include issuer details if available, for instance for the iDEAL or gift card payment methods.
