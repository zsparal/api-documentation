Create refund
=============
.. api-name:: Refunds API
   :version: 1

.. warning:: The v1 API has been deprecated. The v1 API will be supported for the foreseeable future, at least until
             July 2023. However, new features will only be added to the v2 API.

             The documentation for creating refunds in the new v2 API can be found
             :doc:`here </reference/v2/refunds-api/create-refund>`. For more information on the v2 API, refer to our
             :doc:`v2 migration guide </payments/migrating-v1-to-v2>`.

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v1/payments/*id*/refunds

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :organization_access_tokens: true
   :oauth: true

Most payment methods support refunds. This means you can request your payment to be refunded to your customer. The
amount of the refund will be withheld from your next settlement.

Refunds are not available at all for Bitcoin, paysafecard and gift cards. If you need to refund direct debit payments,
please contact our support department.

By supplying the optional ``amount`` parameter, you can issue a partial refund where your customer is only refunded a
fraction of the total payment. It is also possible to refund up to €25.00 more than the original transaction amount,
for example to refund costs for return shipping.

Refunds support descriptions, which we will show in the Dashboard, your exports and pass to your customer if possible.

If you have insufficient balance with Mollie to perform the refund, the refund will be ``queued``. We will automatically
process the refund once your balance increases.

Possible errors
---------------
Sometimes a situation can occur in which it is not possible to perform the refund. In such cases an HTTP ``4xx`` error
will be returned. Some of these situations are illustrated here:

* There might not be enough balance on your account with the payment provider (e.g. PayPal).
* You may have forgotten to grant the appropriate rights to Mollie for the payment provider (PayPal only).
* It is possible that the payment has already been (partially) refunded either directly through Mollie or through the
  payment provider (e.g. PayPal).
* If your account with the payment provider is not set up correctly, it might be possible that Mollie is not
  authenticated to perform refunds for that specific payment method.
* It is not always possible to do a partial refund.

If you perform many refunds in parallel, you may get an HTTP ``503 Service unavailable`` error. In this case, you can be
certain the refund was not performed and you can safely retry the refund.

If there is a connection issue during the creation of a refund (e.g. a client-side time out is triggered) you should
**not retry automatically** as you cannot be sure the refund has been performed or not. In this case we suggest logging
into the Mollie Dashboard, or retrieving the payment's refunds via the API to validate if the refund has been created.

----------
Replace ``id`` in the endpoint URL by the payment's ID, for example ``tr_7UhSN1zuXS``.
