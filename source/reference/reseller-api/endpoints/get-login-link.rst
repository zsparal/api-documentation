Get login link
==============

.. api-name:: Reseller API
   :version: 1

.. endpoint::
   :method: GET
   :url: https://www.mollie.com/api/reseller/v1/get-login-link

.. note:: This API is only for `partners <https://www.mollie.com/partners>`_.

This method allows you to obtain a special link, with which a merchant can be directly logged in.

You are to redirect the merchant to the log-in link. It will log the merchant in, if he wasn't already. In all other
cases, the merchant who was already logged in will remain logged in.

When the customer has not yet accepted Mollie's conditions they must first do so before being redirected.
