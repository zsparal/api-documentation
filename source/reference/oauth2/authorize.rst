Authorize
=========
.. api-name:: Connect API

.. endpoint::
   :method: GET
   :url: https://www.mollie.com/oauth2/authorize

.. note:: You should construct the Authorize URL from the endpoint above with the parameters below. Then, you should
          redirect the resource owner to the Authorize endpoint.


The Authorize endpoint is the endpoint on Mollie web site where the merchant logs in, and grants authorization to your
client application. E.g. when the merchant clicks on the :doc:`Connect with Mollie button </oauth/overview>`, you should
redirect the merchant to the Authorize endpoint.

The resource owner can then grant the authorization to your client application for the scopes you have requested.

Mollie will then redirect the resource owner to the ``redirect_uri`` you have specified. The ``redirect_uri`` will be
appended with a ``code`` parameter, which will contain the *auth token*. You should then exchange the *auth token* for
an *access token* using the :doc:`Tokens API </reference/oauth2/tokens>`.
