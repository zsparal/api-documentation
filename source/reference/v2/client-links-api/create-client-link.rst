Create client link
==================
.. api-name:: Client Links API
   :version: 2
   :beta: true

.. note:: The Client Links API is currently in closed beta. Contact our partner management team if you are interested in
   testing this functionality with us.

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/client-links

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: false
   :organization_access_tokens: true
   :oauth: false

Link a new organization to your :doc:`OAuth application </connect/getting-started>`, in effect creating a new client.
This is a two step process.

First, you must send your customer's details to this endpoint. You can provide data that will be pre-filled during
onboarding.

This endpoint's response will contain a special ``clientLink`` link where you are expected to redirect your customer.
This is the second step.

To the ``clientLink`` link, you must then add the OAuth details of your application, the ``client_id``, ``scope`` you
want to request et cetera. These are the same parameters the :doc:`/reference/oauth2/authorize` endpoint takes. All
accepted parameters are :ref:`listed below <clientlink-parameters>`.

When you redirect your customer, an organization will be created, your OAuth application will be authorized
automatically and your customer will be logged in to their (newly created) Mollie Dashboard.

If the organization already exists, no new organization will be created. Instead the OAuth Authorize screen will be
shown to your customer, allowing them to grant the requested authorizations for their existing organization to your
OAuth application.

Finally, your customer will be redirected back to you (to the ``redirect_uri`` you specified when creating your OAuth
application). Then, the normal :doc:`OAuth Authorize flow </connect/getting-started>` where you exchange an `auth
token` for an `app access token` can be followed.

Once you have received the `app access token` for the organization, you can perform any other API calls on behalf of the
(newly created) organization using OAuth.

Your next step should probably be to create a Profile using the :doc:`/reference/v2/profiles-api/create-profile`
endpoint and :doc:`enable the payment methods </reference/v2/profiles-api/enable-method>` you want your customer to
use with Mollie.

   :type: address object
   :condition: required

   Address of the organization. Note that the ``country`` parameter must always be provided.

   .. parameter:: streetAndNumber
      :type: string
      :condition: conditional

      The street name and house number of the organization. If an address is provided, this field is required.

   .. parameter:: postalCode
      :type: string
      :condition: conditional

      The postal code of the organization. If an address is provided, this field is required for countries with a
      postal code system.

   .. parameter:: city
      :type: string
      :condition: conditional

      The city of the organization. If an address is provided, this field is required.

.. _clientlink-parameters:

Parameters for the ``clientLink`` link
--------------------------------------

The ``clientLink`` link takes a subset of the parameters allowed for the :doc:`/reference/oauth2/authorize` endpoint:
``client_id``, ``state``, ``approval_prompt`` and ``scope``.

.. note:: At a minimum, we recommend you request ``onboarding.read onboarding.write`` and any scopes required for
          orders or payments you want to create. ``onboarding.read`` is required if you wish to follow the onboarding
          progress via the :doc:`/reference/v2/onboarding-api/get-onboarding-status` endpoint
          or `Mollie Dashboard <https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/partners/clients>`_.

Example
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: none
   :linenos:

   https://my.mollie.com/dashboard/client-link/finalize/csr_vZCnNQsV2UtfXxYifWKWH?client_id=app_j9Pakf56Ajta6Y65AkdTtAv&state=decafbad&scope=onboarding.read+organization.read+payments.write+payments.read+profiles.write

In case of an invalid value, your customer will be redirected to the redirect URI set for your OAuth application with
the ``error`` and ``error_description`` query parameters added.

.. code-block-selector::
   .. code-block:: bash
