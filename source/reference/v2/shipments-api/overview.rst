Shipments API
=============
The Shipments API allows you to indicate that you have (partially) fulfilled an order that was created with the
:doc:`Orders API </reference/v2/orders-api/overview>`. This implicitly (partially) captures the authorized amount, which
will then be settled to your balance.

The word "shipping" is used in the figurative sense here. It can also mean that a service was provided or digital
content was delivered.

Please refer to the :doc:`Orders API guide </orders/overview>` for a step-by-step guide on implementing the Orders API
and the Shipments API.
