Get capture
===========

.. api-name:: Captures API
   :version: 2

.. warning::
   This API is currently in private beta. If you are interested in participating, please contact your account manager at
   Mollie.

.. endpoint::
   :method: GET
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments/*paymentId*/captures/*id*

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :oauth: true

Retrieve a single capture by its ID. Note the original payment's ID is needed as well.

Captures are used for payments that have the *authorize-then-capture* flow. The only payment methods at the moment
that have this flow are **Klarna Pay later** and **Klarna Slice it**.

Parameters
----------
Replace ``paymentId`` in the endpoint URL by the payment's ID, and replace ``id`` by the capture's ID. For example:
``/v2/payments/tr_7UhSN1zuXS/captures/cpt_4qqhO89gsT``.
