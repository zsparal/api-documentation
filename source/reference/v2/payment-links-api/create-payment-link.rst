Create payment link
===================
.. api-name:: Payment links API
   :version: 2
   :beta: true

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/payment-links

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :organization_access_tokens: true
   :oauth: true

With the Payment Links API you can generate payment links that by default, unlike regular payments, do not expire. The Payment Link can be shared with your customers and will redirect them to them the payment page where they can complete the payment. A :doc:`/reference/v2/payments-api/get-payment` will only be created once the customer initiates the payment.

Parameters
----------
.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - ``description``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

     - This description will also be used as the payment description and will be shown to your customer on their card or bank statement when possible.

   * - .. param-name:: amount

       .. type:: amount object
          :required: true

     - The amount that you want to charge, e.g. ``{"currency":"EUR", "value":"1000.00"}`` if you would want to charge
       €1000.00.

       .. list-table::
          :widths: auto

          * - .. param-name:: currency

              .. type:: string
                 :required: true

            - An `ISO 4217 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217>`_ currency code. The :doc:`currencies supported
              </payments/multicurrency>` depend on the payment methods that are enabled on your account.

          * - ``value``

              .. type:: string
                 :required: true

            - A string containing the exact amount you want to charge in the given currency. Make sure to send the right
              amount of decimals and omit the thousands separator. Non-string values are not accepted.

   * - ``redirectUrl``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - The URL your customer will be redirected to after completing the payment process.

   * - ``webhookUrl``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - Set the webhook URL, where we will send payment link status updates to.

       .. note:: The ``webhookUrl`` is optional, but without a webhook you will miss out on important status changes about your payment link.

          The ``webhookUrl`` must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use ``localhost``. If
          you want to use webhook during development on ``localhost``, you must use a tool like
          `ngrok <https://lornajane.net/posts/2015/test-incoming-webhooks-locally-with-ngrok>`_ to have the webhooks
          delivered to your local machine.

   * - ``expiresAt``

       .. type:: datetime
          :required: false

     - The expiry date of the payment link in ISO 8601 format. For example: ``2021-12-24T12:00:16+01:00``. It will always be stored in UTC timezone.

Access token parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are using :doc:`organization access tokens </guides/authentication>` or are creating an
:doc:`OAuth app </oauth/overview>`, the only mandatory extra parameter is the ``profileId`` parameter. With it, you can
specify which profile the payment belongs to. Organizations can have multiple profiles for each of their websites. See
:doc:`Profiles API </reference/v2/profiles-api/get-profile>` for more information.

.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - ``profileId``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

     - The website profile's unique identifier, for example ``pfl_3RkSN1zuPE``.

   * - ``testmode``

       .. type:: boolean
          :required: false

     - Set this to true to only retrieve payment links made in test mode. By default, only live payment links are
       returned.

Response
--------
