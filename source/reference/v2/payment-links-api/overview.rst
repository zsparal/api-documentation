Payment links API
=================
With the Payment links API you can generate a payment link to share with your customer. The payment link can for example
be attached to an unpaid invoice or shared via email or chat applications.

This API is different from the :doc:`Payments API </reference/v2/payments-api/overview>`, since links generated by that
API are only short-lived. The Payments API should therefore only be used when the customer is ready to check out, while
the Payment links API can be used in cases where the customer wants to pay at their own convenience.
