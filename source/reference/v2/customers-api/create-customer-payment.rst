Create customer payment
=======================
.. api-name:: Customers API
   :version: 2

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/customers/*customerId*/payments

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :oauth: true

Creates a payment for the customer.

Linking customers to payments enables a number of
`Mollie Checkout <https://www.mollie.com/en/checkout>`_ features, including:

* Keeping track of payment preferences for your customers.
* Enabling your customers to charge a previously used credit card with a single click.
* Improved payment insights in your dashboard.
* :doc:`Recurring payments </payments/recurring>`.

.. note:: This endpoint is a shortcut for :doc:`creating a payment </reference/v2/payments-api/create-payment>` with a
          ``customerId`` parameter.

Parameters
----------
Replace ``customerId`` in the endpoint URL by the customer's ID, for example ``cst_8wmqcHMN4U``.

This endpoint accepts the same parameters as the :doc:`Create payment </reference/v2/payments-api/create-payment>`
endpoint. For recurring payments, the following parameters have notable differences in comparison to regular payments:

.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - ``sequenceType``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - Enables recurring payments. If set to ``first``, a first payment for the customer is created, allowing
       the customer to agree to automatic recurring charges taking place on their account in the future. If set to
       ``recurring``, the customer is charged automatically.

   * - ``redirectUrl``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - If the ``recurringType`` parameter is set to ``recurring``, this parameter can be omitted. Since the payment will
       take place without customer interaction, a redirect is not needed.

Response
--------
``201`` ``application/hal+json; charset=utf-8``

A payment object is returned, as described in :doc:`Get payment </reference/v2/payments-api/get-payment>`.
