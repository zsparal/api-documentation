Get Payment API
===============
.. api-name:: Payments API
   :version: 2

.. endpoint::
   :method: GET
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments/*id*

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :organization_access_tokens: true
   :oauth: true

Retrieve a single payment object by its payment token.

.. note:: We call your webhook when the :doc:`payment status changes </payments/status-changes>`, so there's no
          need to poll this endpoint for status changes.

Parameters
----------
Replace ``id`` in the endpoint URL by the payment's ID, for example ``tr_7UhSN1zuXS``.

Access token parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are using :doc:`organization access tokens </guides/authentication>` or are creating an
:doc:`OAuth app </oauth/overview>`, the ``testmode`` query string parameter is available. You must pass this as a parameter
in the query string if you want to retrieve a payment that was created in test mode.

.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - ``testmode``

       .. type:: boolean
          :required: false

     - Set this to ``true`` to get a payment made in test mode. If you omit this parameter, you can only retrieve live
       mode payments.

This endpoint allows you to include additional information by appending the following values via the ``include``
querystring parameter.

* ``details.qrCode`` Include a :doc:`QR code </guides/qr-codes>` object. Only available for iDEAL, Bancontact
  and bank transfer payments.

query string parameter.
