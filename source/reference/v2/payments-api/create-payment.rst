Create Payment API
==================
.. api-name:: Payments API
   :version: 2

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :organization_access_tokens: true
   :oauth: true

Payment creation is elemental to the Mollie API: this is where most payment implementations start off.

Once you have created a payment, you should redirect your customer to the URL in the ``_links.checkout`` property from
the response.

To wrap your head around the payment process, an explanation and flow charts can be found in the
:doc:`Payments API Overview </payments/overview>`.

.. note::
   :ref:`Optional parameters<payment-method-specific-parameters>` are accepted for certain payment methods.

Parameters
----------
.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - .. param-name:: amount

       .. type:: amount object
          :required: true

     - The amount that you want to charge, e.g. ``{"currency":"EUR", "value":"1000.00"}`` if you would want to charge
       €1000.00.

       You can find the `minimum and maximum amounts <https://help.mollie.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000667365-What-are-the-minimum-and-maximum-amounts-per-payment-method->`_
       per payment method in our help center. Additionally, they can be retrieved using the :doc:`/reference/v2/methods-api/get-method`.

       .. list-table::
          :widths: auto

          * - .. param-name:: currency

              .. type:: string
                 :required: true

            - An `ISO 4217 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217>`_ currency code. The :doc:`currencies supported
              </payments/multicurrency>` depend on the payment methods that are enabled on your account.

          * - ``value``

              .. type:: string
                 :required: true

            - A string containing the exact amount you want to charge in the given currency. Make sure to send the right
              amount of decimals and omit the thousands separator. Non-string values are not accepted.

   * - ``description``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

     - The description of the payment you're creating. This will be shown to your customer on their card or bank
       statement when possible. We truncate the description automatically according to the limits of the used payment
       method. The description is also visible in any exports you generate.

       We recommend you use a unique identifier so that you can always link the payment to the order in your back
       office. This is particularly useful for bookkeeping.

   * - ``redirectUrl``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - The URL your customer will be redirected to after the payment process.

       It could make sense for the ``redirectUrl`` to contain a unique identifier – like your order ID – so you can show
       the right page referencing the order when your customer returns.

       Only for payments with the ``sequenceType`` parameter set to ``recurring``, you can omit this parameter.
       Additionally, for payments that are created with the ``applePayPaymentToken`` parameter, the redirect URL can
       also be omitted.

       *For all other payments, this parameter is mandatory.*

   * - ``webhookUrl``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - Set the webhook URL, where we will send payment status updates to.

       .. note:: The ``webhookUrl`` is optional, but without a webhook you will miss out on important
          :doc:`status changes </guides/webhooks>` to your payment.

          The ``webhookUrl`` must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use ``localhost``. If
          you want to use webhook during development on ``localhost``, you must use a tool like
          `ngrok <https://lornajane.net/posts/2015/test-incoming-webhooks-locally-with-ngrok>`_ to have the webhooks
          delivered to your local machine.


   * - .. param-name:: locale

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

       .. _parameters_locale:

     - Allows you to preset the language to be used in the hosted payment pages shown to the consumer. Setting a
       locale is highly recommended and will greatly improve your conversion rate. When this parameter is omitted, the
       browser language will be used instead if supported by the payment method. You can provide any ISO 15897 locale,
       but our hosted payment pages currently only support the following languages:

       Possible values: ``en_US`` ``nl_NL`` ``nl_BE`` ``fr_FR`` ``fr_BE`` ``de_DE`` ``de_AT`` ``de_CH`` ``es_ES``
       ``ca_ES`` ``pt_PT`` ``it_IT`` ``nb_NO`` ``sv_SE`` ``fi_FI`` ``da_DK`` ``is_IS`` ``hu_HU`` ``pl_PL`` ``lv_LV``
       ``lt_LT``

   * - ``method``

       .. type:: string|array
          :required: false

     - Normally, a payment method screen is shown. However, when using this parameter, you can choose a specific payment
       method and your customer will skip the selection screen and is sent directly to the chosen payment method.
       The parameter enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into your website.

       You can also specify the methods in an array. By doing so we will still show the payment method selection
       screen but will only show the methods specified in the array. For example, you can use this functionality to only
       show payment methods from a specific country to your customer ``['bancontact', 'belfius', 'inghomepay']``.

       Possible values: ``applepay`` ``bancontact`` ``banktransfer`` ``belfius`` ``creditcard`` ``directdebit`` ``eps``
       ``giftcard`` ``giropay`` ``ideal`` ``inghomepay`` ``kbc`` ``mybank``  ``paypal`` ``paysafecard`` ``przelewy24`` ``sofort``

       .. note:: If you are looking to create payments with the Klarna Pay later or Klarna Slice it payment methods,
                 please use the :doc:`/reference/v2/orders-api/create-order` instead.

   * - ``metadata``

       .. type:: mixed
          :required: false

     - Provide any data you like, for example a string or a JSON object. We will save the data alongside the
       payment. Whenever you fetch the payment with our API, we'll also include the metadata. You can use up to
       approximately 1kB.

   * - ``sequenceType``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - Indicate which type of payment this is in a recurring sequence. If set to ``first``, a
       :ref:`first payment <payments/recurring/first-payment>` is created for the customer, allowing the customer to
       agree to automatic recurring charges taking place on their account in the future. If set to ``recurring``, the
       customer's card is charged automatically.

       Defaults to ``oneoff``, which is a regular non-recurring payment (see also:
       :doc:`Recurring </payments/recurring>`).

       Possible values: ``oneoff`` ``first`` ``recurring``

       .. warning:: Using recurring payments with PayPal is only possible if PayPal has activated Reference
                    Transactions on your merchant account. Check if you account is eligible via our
                    :doc:`Methods API </reference/v2/methods-api/list-methods>`. Make sure to set the
                    ``sequenceType`` parameter to ``first``. Your account is eligible if you get PayPal as
                    method returned.

   * - ``customerId``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - The ID of the :doc:`Customer </reference/v2/customers-api/get-customer>` for whom the payment is being created.
       This is used for :doc:`recurring payments </payments/recurring>` and
       :doc:`single click payments </guides/checkout>`.

   * - ``mandateId``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - When creating recurring payments, the ID of a specific :doc:`Mandate </reference/v2/mandates-api/get-mandate>`
       may be supplied to indicate which of the consumer's accounts should be credited.

   * - ``restrictPaymentMethodsToCountry``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - |
       | For digital goods in most jurisdictions, you must apply the VAT rate from your customer’s country.
         Choose the VAT rates you have used for the order to ensure your customer’s country matches the VAT country.
         Use this parameter to restrict the payment methods available to your customer to those from a single country.
       |
       | If available, the credit card method will still be offered, but only cards from the allowed country are accepted.

.. _payment-method-specific-parameters:

Payment method specific parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you specify the ``method`` parameter, optional parameters may be available for the payment method. If no method is
specified, you can still send the optional parameters and we will apply them when the consumer selects the relevant
payment method.

Access token parameters

:doc:`OAuth app </oauth/overview>`, the only mandatory extra parameter is the ``profileId`` parameter. With it, you can
specify which profile the payment belongs to. Organizations can have multiple profiles for each of their websites. See
:doc:`Profiles API </reference/v2/profiles-api/get-profile>` for more information.

QR codes
^^^^^^^^
To create a payment with a QR code embedded in the API response, explicitly set the payment method and call the API endpoint with an
include request for ``details.qrCode`` in the query string:

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments?include=details.qrCode

QR codes can be generated for iDEAL, Bancontact and bank transfer payments.

Refer to the :doc:`Get payment </reference/v2/payments-api/get-payment>` reference to see what the API response looks
like when the QR code is included.

Response
--------
``201`` ``application/hal+json``

A payment object is returned, as described in :doc:`/reference/v2/payments-api/get-payment`.
