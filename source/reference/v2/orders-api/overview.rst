Orders API
==========
The Orders API allows you to create *payment intents* with order management functionalities. The API is specifically
designed for order-based payment processing. It can be seen as an extension of the
:doc:`Payments API </reference/v2/payments-api/overview>` for more specific use cases.

Some payment methods require order details (and therefore the Orders API) to function, such as Klarna Pay later and
Klarna Slice it.

In its simplest form, processing an order requires three steps: setting up the order with the
:doc:`Create order endpoint </reference/v2/orders-api/create-order>`, sending the customer to our
:doc:`hosted checkout </payments/hosted-checkout>` for authorization, and capturing the order lines using the
:doc:`Shipments API </reference/v2/shipments-api/overview>` as you ship the items to the customer. The captured
amount or amounts will then be settled to your account.

Please refer to the :doc:`Orders API guide </orders/overview>` for a step-by-step guide on implementing the Orders API.
