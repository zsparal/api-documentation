Refunds and chargebacks
=======================
Refund and chargeback processing works differently based on whether you work with
:doc:`Application fees </connect/application-fees>` or with :doc:`Split payments </connect/splitting-payments>`.

Refunding a payment with application fees
-----------------------------------------
When using :doc:`Application fees </connect/application-fees>`, the connected merchant account is in full control of the
payment, and any refunds and chargebacks are also processed on their account.

As a platform, you can create refunds on behalf of the connected account by using the
:doc:`Refunds API </reference/v2/refunds-api/overview>` with the connected account's permission. Refunding
previously charged application fees is not possible, however.

For more fine-grained control over the refund and chargeback flows, consider using
:doc:`Split payments </connect/splitting-payments>` instead.

Refunding a split payment
-------------------------
When using :doc:`Split payments </connect/splitting-payments>`, your Mollie account is the owner of the payment
and you are therefor responsible for initiating refunds.

You can issue a refund for a split payment by :doc:`creating a refund </reference/v2/refunds-api/create-payment-refund>`
on the original payment, like you would with any other payment. By default, the full refund will be deducted from the
platform balance. In other words, by default the parts of the payment that were sent to connected accounts will remain
untouched.

If you wish to pull back the money that was sent to connected accounts, you can do so by 'reversing the routes' when
issuing the refund request.

For a full reversal of the split that was specified during payment creation, simply set ``reverseRouting=true`` when
creating the refund, so that a full compensation is created for every route of the original payment.
This flag **only works with full refunds**, namely a refund of the same amount (or more) than the
original payment. For partial refunds and for more fine grained control on how compensations are created
see next paragraph.

In the example below we will refund the €10,00 payment from earlier, and pull back the €3,50 and the €4,00 that were
sent to connected accounts ``org_23456`` and ``org_56789``.

       -d "reverseRouting=true"

                    "currency": "EUR"
               },
               "source": {

                    "value": "4.50",
                    "currency": "EUR"
               },
               "source": {
                    "organizationId": "org_56789"
               }
           }
       ]
       "...": { }
   }

Partial refund for a split payment
----------------------------------

If you wish to pull back the money that was sent to connected accounts within the creation of a partial refund (namely
a refund of less of the amount of the original payment), you can do so by setting the ``routingReversals`` array in the
request (see :doc:`create a refund </reference/v2/refunds-api/create-payment-refund>`). The to be refunded amount that
remains after rout reversal is deducted from the balance of your account.

In the example below we will partially refund the €10,00 payment from earlier, and pull back €2,00 and €3,00 from the
funds that were sent to connected accounts ``org_23456`` and ``org_56789``. The remaining €1,00 will be deducted from
your account.

   curl -X POST https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments/tr_7UhSN1zuXS/refunds \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer test_dHar4XY7LxsDOtmnkVtjNVWXLSlXsM" \

      -d "amount[value]=6.00" \

      -d "routingReversals[1][source][type]=organization" \
      -d "routingReversals[1][source][organizationId]=org_78901" \
      -d "routingReversals[1][amount][value]=3.00" \

Chargebacks of Split Payments
----------------------------------

Whenever one of your split payment gets charged back, your Mollie account will be charged the Mollie fees and the initial
compensation to the consumer. Depending on the chargeback amount and on whether the payment was split across one or multiple 
submerchants, you might be eligible to receive a compensation for the amount that was routed to the other accounts.

Specifically, if the payment was split between you and only one other organization you will be automatically compensated for the
amount that was routed to the submerchant, independently of the amount of the chargeback but limited to the originally routed amount. 

If the payment was split across multiple submerchants, you will only receive compensations for each of the routes if the chargeback was for 
the full amount of the original payment (or higher). If we receive a chargeback for a lower amount than the original payment, we will
detract the amount from your balance and you will not receive any compensation for it since we can't know which route should be reversed.

In case you and your submerchant(s) decide to object to the chargeback and can provide enough evidence for it to be reversed, any 
amount that was compensated to your account from your submerchant's balances will be returned back to them as soon as we receive the money
from the bank.
