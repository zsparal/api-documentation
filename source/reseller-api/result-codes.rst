Result codes
============
Every API request will be answered with a **result code**. Results will look like:

.. code-block:: XML
   :linenos:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <response version="v1">
     <success>true</success>
     <resultcode>10</resultcode>
     <resultmessage>It works!</resultmessage>
    </response>

The following elements are present in every API result:

* ``<success>`` Indicates whether a request was successfully executed.
* ``<resultcode>`` Indicates which error occurred during the request.
* ``<resultmessage>`` Provides additional information about the result.


**The following result codes are possible for all API requests:**
