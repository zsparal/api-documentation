March 2020
==========

Tuesday, 24th
-------------

- Mollie is moving to a monthly invoicing system. As some settlements span multiple months, these
  settlements will have their associated costs put on multiple invoices (one for each month). To
  accommodate the linking of specific costs to the specific invoice of that month, an ``invoiceId``
  field is included for each monthly period (see the
  :doc:`Get settlement endpoint </reference/v2/settlements-api/get-settlement>`).

  For such settlements that span multiple months, the top-level ``invoiceId`` field now refers only
  to the oldest invoice. This could cause your bookkeeping integration to break as the invoice
  referenced by this ID will no longer cover all costs. The new ``invoiceId`` field of each period
  should be used instead.
- We made it easier to ship a whole order at once by making the ``lines`` parameter in the
  :doc:`Create shipment endpoint </reference/v2/shipments-api/create-shipment>` optional.

Tuesday, 17th
-------------

- It is now possible to update the ``webhookUrl`` and ``redirectUrl`` of an order via the
  :doc:`Update order endpoint </reference/v2/orders-api/update-order>`.

  See the :doc:`Get payment endpoint </reference/v2/payments-api/get-payment>` for more info.

  The new status is especially useful to give a meaningful representation when listing all payments.
