Integrating meal-, eco-, and gift-vouchers
==========================================

.. note:: Vouchers are currently in a closed beta. When you are interesting in using this payment
          method, please reach out your account manager.

A voucher is for certain products given to employees as an employee benefit, allowing them to
eat at outside restaurants, typically for lunch, buying eco product or gifts. In many countries,
vouchers had favorable tax treatment. Vouchers are typically in the form of paper tickets but are
gradually being replaced by electronic vouchers in the form of a special payment card. It's possible
to accept these cards via Mollie.

Contracting and settlement
--------------------------
In order to use vouchers as a payment method, you should have a contract with the owner of the brand(s)
you want to accept. For example, with Sodexo Belgium for the Sodexo vouchers. Once you have a contract,
you can activate the brand via the `Mollie Dashboard <https://www.mollie.com/dashboard>`_. Enter
your contract ID and enable the brand(s) of the brand owner(s) you want to provide.

In contrast to other payment methods such as iDEAL or credit card, Mollie does not handle settlement
on your behalf. Settlement is handled by the brand owner, like Sodexo Belgium.

Integration via the Orders API
------------------------------
Vouchers are only available as payment method via the :doc:`Orders API </reference/v2/orders-api/create-order>`
since these can only be used for eligible products. Therefor you should include the ``lines.category``
parameter for all your order lines. We will calculate the eligible amount based on this parameter.

If you do not specify the ``lines.category`` for at least one order line, the voucher method will
not be available to the shopper.

Mollie supports stacking transactions, e.g. starting with a partial voucher payment and then
finalizing the payment using more vouchers or one of the other payment methods.

Canceled and abandoned payments
-------------------------------
If your shopper cancels or abandons the payment after partially paying with one or more vouchers,
the amount paid with the vouchers will **not** be refunded due to the limitation set by the brand
issuers. You will still receive the money via the brand owner and should handle a refund by yourself.

Refunds
-------
You cannot perform any voucher refunds due to the limitation set by the brand issuers. However,
if another payment method was used during the checkout, you can refund the part paid with the
payment method used for the remainer amount.
