Orders API
==========

.. warning::
   This API is currently in private beta. If you are interested in participating, please contact your account manager at
   Mollie.

The **Orders API** allows you to use Mollie for your order management. Some payment methods, such as Klarna Pay later
require the Orders API and cannot be used with the :doc:`Payments API </payments/overview>`.

How does the Orders API work?
-----------------------------

#. For every order in your webshop, you create an order using the :doc:`Create Order API </reference/v2/orders-api/create-order>`.

#. The :ref:`Create Order API response <get-order-response>` contains the ``_links.checkout`` property. This is a link where you should redirect
   your customer to for checking out.

#. If the checkout is successful, the order will change it's state to ``authorized`` or ``paid``, depending on the
   payment method used by your customer.

   We will use webhooks to inform your back office of the order state change.

#. Once you start shipping the order, you should send the shipment information to Mollie using the
   :doc:`Create Shipment API </reference/v2/shipments-api/create-shipment>`. Alternatively, you can use the Mollie
   Dashboard.

   For some payment methods, shipping is required to ensure your account will get settled for the order amount.

   You should ship the order within 28 days.

#. If there are some lines in the order you will not ship, you can cancel them using the
   :doc:`Cancel Order line API </reference/v2/orders-api/cancel-order-line>`.

Order expiry
------------

An order expires after 28 days. Any authorizations on the order will be released.
