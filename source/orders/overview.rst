Orders API
==========

.. warning::
   This API is currently in private beta. If you are interested in participating, please contact your account manager at
   Mollie.

The **Orders API** allows you to use Mollie for your order management. Some payment methods, such as Klarna Pay later
require the Orders API and cannot be used with the :doc:`Payments API </payments/overview>`.

How does the Orders API work?
-----------------------------

#. For every order in your webshop, you create an order using the :doc:`Create Order API </reference/v2/orders-api/create-order>`.

#. The :ref:`Create Order API response <get-order-response>` contains the ``_links.checkout`` property. This is a link
   where you should redirect your customer to for checking out.

#. If the checkout is successful, the order will change it's state to ``authorized`` or ``paid``, depending on the
   payment method used by your customer.

   We will use webhooks to inform your back office of the order state change.

#. Once you start shipping the order, you should send the shipment information to Mollie using the
   :doc:`Create Shipment API </reference/v2/shipments-api/create-shipment>`. Alternatively, you can use the Mollie
   Dashboard.

   For some payment methods, shipping is required to ensure you will be settled for the full order amount.

   You should ship the order within 28 days or the order will expire.

#. If there are some lines in the order you will not ship, you can cancel them using the
   :doc:`Cancel Order line API </reference/v2/orders-api/cancel-order-line>`.

Second chance emails
--------------------

Should your customer's initial payment fail, you can create additional payments for the order using the Create Order
Payment API or alternative from the Mollie Dashboard.

Mollie can also automatically send payment emails to your customer.

If you do not intent to fulfill an authorized order, you should cancel the order using the
:doc:`Cancel Order API </reference/v2/orders-api/cancel-order>`.

Order expiry
------------

An order expires after 28 days. Any authorizations on the order will be released. You can check the ``expiresAt``
property on the order or in the Mollie Dashboard to see when the order expires exactly.
