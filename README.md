[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mollie/api-documentation.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)


This project contains the source of all of Mollie's public API documentation. The full documentation (in an easy to use
format) may be found at https://docs.mollie.com.

## Contribute

- [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mollie/api-documentation/issues)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/mollie/api-documentation)

We take pull requests on our documentation as well, if you think that something can be improved please open a PR.

The documentation is formatted using [reStructuredText](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/rest.html). 
Additionally we use a [Sphinx extension](https://cloud-sptheme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lib/cloud_sptheme.ext.table_styling.html#module-cloud_sptheme.ext.table_styling) to help format tables.

All documentation should be written in US English.

Note that PhpStorm comes with a reStructuredText plugin. You can enable it from the Plugins preferences pane. It enables
some syntax highlighting.

### Prerequisites

- `python3` (must be in your `$PATH`, use `brew install python3`)
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), Python's package manager. [Installation instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
- Node > 12.x. Installation using the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended. 

### Running locally

Create a fork, or clone this repository if you have write access:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:mollie/api-documentation.git
```

Then visit the downloaded repository and install dependencies:

```shell
cd api-documentation
make install
```

### Generate HTML and supporting files

Finally, build the documentation, its CSS and JS files by running:

```shell
make html
```

You can now preview the generated documentation by opening `build/html/index.html`:

```shell
open build/html/index.html
```

### Making changes to copy

After running `make html` at least once, you can use `make html-only` to quickly update the HTML files if you changed
some copy. This way, you can have a quick [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).

```shell
$ make html-only
Running Sphinx v1.7.1
...
updating environment: 0 added, 2 changed, 0 removed
...
build succeeded.

The HTML pages are in build/html.
$ open build/html/index.html
```

Sphinx will only update files for which the source files have changed.

### Styling docs

You can make changes to the styling by starting a web server locally:

```shell
make start
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to preview your changes. CSS & JS changes will appear without the need to refresh your
browser.

### Releasing new versions of the documentation

Deployment is handled using continuous deployment via [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/).
Successful builds on the `master` branch will be automatically deployed.
